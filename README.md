• **Outcome of the project:**

• **Built a regression model to predict the positive cases of the COVID-19, as it has become a pandemic, leveraged the applications of Convolutional Neural Network, ARIMA and FB Prophet algorithms to come up with useful insights**

• **Visualized the data by grouping the COVID-19 cases statewise, using matplotlib, plotly and seaborn.**

• **Increased the base line accuracy of the convolutional neural networks to 98% from 50% model using Keras with TensorFlow as backend by regularizing (Kernel regularization), increasing training data, pre-trained model (VGG-16), flipping, rotating, adding  noise and dropouts to normalize the model to the data.**

• **Visualized the chest xray images using Image.**

• **The model is learning through each epoch, and the accuracy of the training model is consistently increasing which shows a solid training model. Confusion matrix was plotted. The model is doing great with good ration of tp,tn>fp,fn.**

• **The training accuracy of the CNN model is: 94%, The test accuracy of the CNN model is 98%, and the validation accuracy is 97-98%**
